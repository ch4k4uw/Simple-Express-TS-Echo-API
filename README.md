# Simple echo Express Typescript API



Want you know your apps outputs in a simple way? Download this simple code and play with your app.

All you need to do is:

- Download the source code and...
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```



**"No no, I want to change to add more intelligence"**
Ok, it's a so simple API, you just need to change the `index.ts` e everything will work as you can.



**"But I don't have enough time to spend with `npm build` and `npm start`"**
Ok ok, no problem... Just start the watch and the nodemon with the following commands:

```sh
$ npm run tsc-watch
$ npm run watch
```

**"But what is the host and port where this API will run on?"**
On your localhost, at `10003` port



**"But does it have any feature on this?"**

Oh yeah, I was almost forgetting... You can send a request with query string `delay` to simulate some delays on the API responses.



That's all folks
